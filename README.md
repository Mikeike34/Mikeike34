### About Me
Software Engineering graduate who loves building thoughtful web apps and exploring how things work under the hood. Experienced with JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and always curious about new tools and tech. When I am not coding, you might find me with a book in my hands or tinkering with some side project that has become my latest obsession. 

### Currently
I am currently enrolled in an exam prep course to better prepare me for the AWS developer certificate exam. I look forward to growing my skills and learning more about amazon's cloud tools.
